        <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>whatbetter is a script which automatically transcodes and uploads FLACs on What.CD.</p>

<p>The following command will scan through every FLAC you have ever downloaded, determine which formats are needed, transcode the FLAC to each needed format, and upload each format to What.CD -- no user input required.</p>

<pre><code>$ whatbetter --all
</code></pre>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>As an artifact of power, whatbetter requires that its would-be wielders pass a series of tests before use. This is all in the spirit of What.CD, of course.</p>

<p>First of all, you're going to need Python to run whatbetter. Python 3 is unsupported due to the dependency on mechanize, which does not currently support Python 3.</p>

<p>Once you've got Python installed, you need several modules: mechanize, mutagen, lxml, BeautifulSoup, and argparse. Try this:</p>

<pre><code># pip install mechanize mutagen lxml BeautifulSoup argparse
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you have setuptools installed, you can do this (in the source directory):</p>

<pre><code># ./setup.py install
</code></pre>

<p>This should theoretically install all required dependencies automatically.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you need several external programs: mktorrent, flac, lame, oggenc, ffmpeg, and neroAacEnc. The method of installing these programs varies depending on your operating system, but if you're using something like Ubuntu you can do this:</p>

<pre><code># aptitude install mktorrent flac lame vorbis-tools ffmpeg
</code></pre>

<p>For neroAacEnc, you need to download the encoder from <a href="http://www.nero.com/eng/downloads-nerodigital-nero-aac-codec.php">nero</a>, extract it, and place the binaries somewhere on your PATH. If you're on a 64 bit system make sure you have <code>ia32-libs</code> installed.</p>

<p>At this point you may begin to speak with whatbetter. Perform the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ whatbetter
</code></pre>

<p>And you will receive a notification stating that you should edit the configuration file ~/.whatbetter/config (if you're lucky).</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>You've made it far! Congratulations. Open up the file ~/.whatbetter/config in a text editor. You're going to see something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[whatcd]
username =
password = 
passkey = 
data_dir =
torrent_dir =
</code></pre>

<p>The username and password are your What.CD login credentials. The passkey is your tracker passkey. The data_dir is the directory where your downloads are stored. The torrent_dir is the directory where torrents should be created (e.g., your watch directory).</p>

<p>You should end up with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[whatcd]
username = RequestBunny
password = clapton
passkey = as309uasdfklwwe90sakjlsd
data_dir = ~/Downloads
torrent_dir = ~/Torrents
</code></pre>

<p>Alright! Now you're ready to use whatbetter.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<pre><code>usage: whatbetter [-h] [-A] [-a] [--config CONFIG] [--cache CACHE]
                [release_urls [release_urls ...]]

positional arguments:
release_urls     the URL where the release is located

optional arguments:
-h, --help       show this help message and exit
-A, --auto       attempt to automatically find transcode candidates
-a, --all        search through all snatched torrents for transcode
                candidates
--config CONFIG  the location of the configuration file (default:
                ~/.whatbetter/config)
--cache CACHE    the location of the cache (default: ~/.whatbetter/cache)
</code></pre>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>To transcode and upload releases that are listed in the 'Snatch' section of better.php:</p>

<pre><code>$ whatbetter --auto
</code></pre>

<p>To expand the search to every FLAC you've ever downloaded (this may take a while):</p>

<pre><code>$ whatbetter --all
</code></pre>

<p>To transcode and upload a specific release (provided you have already downloaded the FLAC and it is located in your data_dir):</p>

<pre><code>$ whatbetter http://what.cd/torrents.php?id=1000&amp;torrentid=1000000
</code></pre>
