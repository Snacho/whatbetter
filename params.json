{"tagline":"Automatically transcode and upload torrents.","body":"Introduction\r\n------------\r\n\r\nwhatbetter is a script which automatically transcodes and uploads FLACs\r\non What.CD.\r\n\r\nThe following command will scan through every FLAC you have ever\r\ndownloaded, determine which formats are needed, transcode the FLAC to\r\neach needed format, and upload each format to What.CD -- automatically.\r\n\r\n    $ whatbetter\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nYou're going to need to install a few dependencies before using\r\nwhatbetter.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, you will need Python 2.7 or newer.\r\n\r\nOnce you've got Python installed, you will need a few modules: mechanize,\r\nmutagen, and requests. Try this:\r\n\r\n    $ pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you have setuptools installed, you can do this (in the\r\nsource directory):\r\n\r\n    $ python setup.py install\r\n\r\nThis should theoretically install all required dependencies\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you need several external programs: mktorrent, flac,\r\nlame, and sox. The method of installing these programs varies\r\ndepending on your operating system, but if you're using something like\r\nUbuntu you can do this:\r\n\r\n    # aptitude install mktorrent flac lame sox\r\n\r\nAt this point you may execute the following command:\r\n\r\n    $ whatbetter\r\n\r\nAnd you will receive a notification stating that you should edit the\r\nconfiguration file \\~/.whatbetter/config (if you're lucky).\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nYou've made it far! Congratulations. Open up the file\r\n\\~/.whatbetter/config in a text editor. You're going to see something\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n    [whatcd]\r\n    username =\r\n    password = \r\n    data_dir =\r\n    output_dir =\r\n    torrent_dir =\r\n    formats = flac, v0, 320, v2\r\n    media = sacd, soundboard, web, dvd, cd, dat, vinyl, blu-ray\r\n\r\n`username` and `password` are your What.CD login credentials. \r\n`data_dir` is the directory where your downloads are stored. \r\n`output_dir` is the directory where your transcodes will be created. If\r\nthe value is blank, `data_dir` will be used.\r\n`torrent_dir` is the directory where torrents should be created (e.g.,\r\nyour watch directory). `formats` is a list of formats that you'd like to\r\nsupport (so if you don't want to upload V2, just remove it from this\r\nlist).\r\n`media` is a list of lossless media types you want to consider for\r\ntranscoding. The default value is all What.CD lossless formats, but if\r\nyou want to transcode only CD and vinyl media, for example, you would\r\nset this to 'cd, vinyl'\r\n\r\nYou should end up with something like this:\r\n\r\n    [whatcd]\r\n    username = RequestBunny\r\n    password = clapton\r\n    data_dir = /srv/downloads\r\n    output_dir =\r\n    torrent_dir = /srv/torrents\r\n    formats = flac, v0, 320\r\n    media = cd, vinyl, web\r\n\r\nAlright! Now you're ready to use whatbetter.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n    usage: whatbetter [-h] [-s] [--config CONFIG] [--cache CACHE]\r\n                      [release_urls [release_urls ...]]\r\n\r\n    positional arguments:\r\n      release_urls     the URL where the release is located\r\n\r\n    optional arguments:\r\n      -h, --help       show this help message and exit\r\n      -s, --single     only add one format per release (useful for getting unique\r\n                       groups)\r\n      --config CONFIG  the location of the configuration file (default:\r\n                       ~/.whatbetter/config)\r\n      --cache CACHE    the location of the cache (default: ~/.whatbetter/cache)\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n--------\r\n\r\nTo transcode and upload every FLAC you've every downloaded (this may\r\ntake a while):\r\n\r\n    $ whatbetter\r\n\r\nTo transcode and upload a specific release (provided you have already\r\ndownloaded the FLAC and it is located in your `data_dir`):\r\n\r\n    $ whatbetter http://what.cd/torrents.php?id=1000\\&torrentid=1000000\r\n\r\nNote that if you specify a particular release(s), whatbetter will\r\nignore your configuration's media types and attempt to transcode the\r\nreleases you have specified regardless of their media type (so long as\r\nthey are lossless types).\r\n","google":"UA-15976986-5","note":"Don't delete this file!
